<h2>Story</h2>

<p>You are an ordinary miller, from a good well-doing family with
centuries of farming experience. All your life, you have dreamed of
nothing but keeping your farm prosperous, and your mill grinding.</p>

<p>But last night, you had this terrifying premonition in your dream.
You were so shaken in the morning that you went to see the local priest
who was just as scared as you were. He explained that a really great
evil is stirring in its lair, somewhere deep in the Dark Lands, and
legends tell that nothing stands in its way unless the citizens defend
what is theirs. Those touched by this premonition must at once begin
practicing for the ultimate confrontation with the evil one itself!</p>

<p>So without further ado, you head back to your farmhouse, find the
family heirloom sword from grandgrandfather's travel chest (now at least
you know why you inherited it!) and sell the farmhouse to get some cash.
You certainly feel that the Evul One is quaking in its boots once you
get through with him! But first of all, you need to become the greatest
fighter this world has ever seen - and to do that, you need practice,
lots and lots of practice...</p>

<h2>New player primer</h2>

<p>Miller's Quest is a game of adventure and intrigue, and unless you
can prevent it, a game of death. But mostly intrigue, because there
isn't a great deal that the player can do. The point of the game is
quite simple: You should leave the milling to the pros. And these days,
nothing does number-milling better than computers!</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>The installation should be fairly straightforward.</p>

<p>You need to install Ruby first - I'm convinced it works in Ruby
1.8.3, not sure about any other versions.</p>

<p>Then, you just need to put the <tt>millerquest</tt> folder somewhere.
The game can be run with <tt>ruby millerquest.rb</tt>, or, if you want
to open a saved game automatically,
<tt>ruby millerquest.rb <i>savefile</i></tt>.</p>

<p>On *NIX platforms, the thing is built so that the folder can be kept
anywhere (say, <tt>/usr/local/lib/millerquest</tt>) and you can make a
symbolic link to it anywhere (say, <tt>/usr/local/games/millerquest</tt>
or something). The game will look for data and library files from the
same directory the actual millerquest.rb file is installed to.</p>

<h3>Playing</h3>

<p>When you start the game without savegame file name, you're shown the
main menu. You can load the saved game here as well, or start a new
game.</p>

<p>The only interactive feature in the game is the character creation.
You're asked for character name and gender. You're allowed to pick your
class and race. Rolling for statistics is easy: You can either accept
the values, reroll, or use the Munchkin option, which will raise all
sub-10 stats to 10.</p>

<p>The game will be saved automatically when needed. To quit the game
nicely, hit Ctrl+C, and the game is automatically saved in this
situation too. (Game crashes due to bug, and any heavier than Ctrl-C
close-down tools, will lead to the game not being saved.)</p>

<h3>Things to note</h3>

<p>I'm not going to guarantee that the characters stay completely compatible
(or balanced) through upgrades. So, when upgrading the game, I suggest
starting over a completely new game.</p>

<h2>Hacking</h2>

<p>As hinted earlier, the game is written in Ruby programming language -
source is included, since this is a scripting language. All game data,
including save games are stored in YAML format, which is a plain text
format, so editing save games and the game data should be fairly easy.
If you want the developer documentation for the game, you can just use
command <tt>rake rdoc</tt> to generate it (needs rake and rdoc, of
course...) Too bad the documentation isn't very good right now though,
you'd better just read the source.</p>
